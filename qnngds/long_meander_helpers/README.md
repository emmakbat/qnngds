This folder contains helper functions for assisting with drawing
arbitrary long meanders.

* coords.py - defines a Coords class with functions that can more easily
create sets of x, y coordinates for a CPW in a "turtle" drawing fashion
and be quickly converted to a gds device
* generator_scripts.py - provides some building blocks for creating the right
Coords for different meanders
